# Projects
## [Data Science Salaries](https://github.com/kailuker/Portfolio/tree/main/data_science_salaries)
### Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Seaborn), Tableau
I used real world data to investigate what factors contribute to salaries in the data science field, and predict the highest paid roles. I used a linear regression model for this project, with Python in a Jupyter Notebook, and displayed the results visually in a [Tableau Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/kai.luker/viz/BechdelTestProject/BechdelTestProject).

## [E-Commerce Reviews](https://github.com/kailuker/Portfolio/tree/main/ecommerce_reviews)
### Python (Pandas, Seaborn)
Using customer review data, I attempted to predict numeric ratings for an e-commerce clothing company. I used Python to create a linear regression model within a Jupyter Notebook.

## [Bechdel Test Analyses](https://github.com/kailuker/Portfolio/tree/main/Bechdel_test)
### Tableau
In an interactive Tableau dashboard, I visualized the relationship between ticket sales and various reasons that films failed the Bechdel Test. The Bechdel Test is a rough gauge of gender equality in movies.
